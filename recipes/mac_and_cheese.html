    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Macaroni and cheese is a beloved comfort food featuring cooked elbow macaroni pasta coated in a creamy cheese sauce. 
        The sauce, often made with cheddar and spices, gives the dish its rich and indulgent flavor. Variations include additions like bacon, breadcrumbs, or vegetables. 
        Baked versions have a crispy crust on top. Served hot, it's a staple in American cuisine, enjoyed for its satisfying, cheesy goodness and nostalgic appeal.</p>
